      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src = "IMG_4098.jpg" alt = "Me with my Croatian Foklore Outift" height = 200 >
      <p>Before we get into the more intresting parts of this website I feel like its important
        to give a little intorduction about myself and to explain why I wanted to do this.
        My name is Matija Bebek and currently I am fourth year student at Loyola University studying computer
        science. Outside of my studies I also can say that I have another passion and that is learning
        the history of my people and learning Croatian Foklore Dances. You can actually a picture with my Croatian
        Folklore attire as well as my Croatian intstrument I play called a bisernica</p>
      <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>One of the main reasons I wanted to do this was because as I started to see my intrest in both
        thing regarding tech as well as seeking intrest regarding something from my past I wanted to see if there
        was a way where I can bring the two things I love togethor. So I decided to make and information website about
        the four regions of Croatian Foklore. One of the other reasons I also wanted to do this is I saw that there werent
        really many websites that explained these four regions certianly not in English but as well as not in Croatian as well
        so I thought that if I could make something that it would be easy accesible but also when I am still retaining knowladge of both tech
        and folkore I can still add more in the future.</p>
